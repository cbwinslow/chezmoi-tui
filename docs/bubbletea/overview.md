# Bubble Tea Framework Documentation

Bubble Tea is a powerful framework for building terminal user interfaces in Go. It follows the Elm architecture and provides a simple, elegant way to create TUI applications.

## Core Concepts

### Model
The Model holds the state of your application. It's a simple Go struct that represents your application's state at any point in time.

### Update
The Update function takes a message and the current model, and returns a new model and a command. It's a pure function that describes how the application should change when a message is received.

### View
The View function takes the current model and returns a string that represents the UI. This string is what gets rendered to the terminal.

### Messages
Messages are events that are returned by commands and fed back into the Update function. They can be user input, system events, or data from external sources.

### Commands
Commands are functions that perform I/O operations and eventually return a message to be fed back into the Update function.

## Key Components

### Key Messages
- Key.String(): Get the string representation of a key
- Key.Type: The type of key pressed
- Key.Alt: True if alt was held during the keypress

### Common Commands
- tea.Quit: Quit the program
- tea.Batch: Batch multiple commands together
- tea.Sequence: Sequence commands to run one after the other

### Styles and Rendering
- lipgloss: Complementary styling tool for Bubble Tea
- color.Color: For color operations
